# HeartHeals - A Safe Space for Emotional Support

Welcome to **HeartHeals**, an emotional wellness web application designed and developed by **Lauren Ann Murugi**. This project was built during Phase 1 of my Software Engineering journey, where I learned to combine HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while integrating with a local REST API using `json-server`.

## Purpose

HeartHeals is a single-page application that allows users to:
- Register or log in
- Create a personal support profile
- View other users struggling with similar emotional challenges
- Get matched to a dedicated mentor based on their struggle (e.g., grief, anxiety, stress)
- Edit or delete their profile

This app is designed to simulate the comfort of connection and the power of empathy.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 
- json-server 
- LocalStorage & Fetch API

## Features

- Authentication: Register or log in with a username and password
- Profile Creation: Enter your name, age, phone, location, and struggle
- User List: View a list of other users and their challenges
- Mentor Matching: Automatically assigns a mentor based on your selected struggle
- Edit & Delete: Users can edit their profile or remove it entirely
- Clean UI: Intuitive layout with responsive design

## How to Run It Locally

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:lauren-ann-murugi/Heart-Heals.git
